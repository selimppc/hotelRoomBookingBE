### Task 2. Development skills

    We are creating a hypothetical hotel room booking system. Hotel is unique as it has only one room.

    Clients only use self service.Two thousand clients are competing to book this room simultaneously 
    at all times. Wow, what a popular room :D

    ## Please create an application that would allow clients to book a hotel room:
    ● Clients should be able to see a calendar with vacant/booked date ranges.

        personal details like firstname, lastname and email.
